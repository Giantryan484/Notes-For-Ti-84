Newton's First Law: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

Newton's Second Law: F = ma, Force equals mass times acceleration.

Newton's Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Law of Universal Gravitation: F = G(m1m2)/r^2, the gravitational force between two masses is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

Conservation of Energy: The total energy in a closed system remains constant over time.

Conservation of Momentum: The total momentum of a closed system is conserved unless acted on by external forces.

Ohm's Law: V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.

Wave Equation: v = f*lambda, where v is the wave velocity, f is the frequency, and lambda is the wavelength.

Coulomb's Law: F = k(q1q2)/r^2, the electric force between two charged objects is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Thermal Expansion: Length change = coeff*Initial Length*Temp change, the change in length of an object is proportional to the original length, the change in temperature, and the coefficient of linear expansion.
